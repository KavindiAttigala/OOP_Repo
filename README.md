Ticket Booking System

This project is a real-time ticketing system designed to manage concurrent ticket releases and purchases effectively. Tailored for small-scale event organizers and academic purposes, it ensures robust concurrency management, maintaining data integrity even in multi-threaded environments. The system allows vendors to release tickets and customers to purchase them simultaneously, guaranteeing smooth operations without errors. With a user-friendly configuration interface, the platform is both accessible and efficient. The frontend is developed using Angular, while the backend is powered by Spring Boot.
